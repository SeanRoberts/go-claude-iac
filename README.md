# go-claude-iac

This is a simple tool for generating Terraform config using Go and the
Claude 3 API. I wanted an excuse to play around with Go as well as build something
with Claude 3 so this seemed like a fun idea.

## Running it

Just create a .env file in the project root and put your API key in:

```
API_KEY=your-super-secret-api-key
```
